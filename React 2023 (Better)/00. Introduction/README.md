React is a JavaScript library that is used to build user interfaces, or parts of a website that a person interacts with. Imagine you're building a toy car and you have all the different parts like the wheels, the body, and the steering wheel. React is like the glue that holds all those parts together and makes sure they work well together.

We use React because it makes it easy to build and update user interfaces. It also makes it easy to make our website interactive, so when a person clicks on a button or types something, the website can respond in a certain way.

React is just one of many frameworks (a set of tools and rules) that people use to build websites. Other frameworks include Angular and Vue.js. Each framework has its own strengths and weaknesses, and people choose to use the one that best fits their project.

So, React is a tool that helps us build interactive and good-looking websites. It is a part of JavaScript library, which is easy to use and understand. Think of it like a toy car's steering wheel, it helps you control the toy car and make it move in different directions.
